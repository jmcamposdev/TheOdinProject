    <h1>Baked Feta Pasta</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is the story about another viral TikTok trend that I kinda sorted wanted to hate...but didn't. It's not that I didn't think the idea sounded delicious.
        <br> It's just that the whole thing seemed too simple. Obviously roasting a block of feta with bursting tomatoes is going to be amazing.
        <br> But is it good enough to break the internet? 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pt. cherry or grape tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 shallot, quartered</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed </li>
        <li>1/2 c. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 (8-oz.) block feta</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme </li>
        <li>10 oz. pasta</li>

    </ul>
