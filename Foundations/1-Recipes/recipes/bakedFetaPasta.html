    <h1>Baked Feta Pasta</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is the story about another viral TikTok trend that I kinda sorted wanted to hate...but didn't. It's not that I didn't think the idea sounded delicious.
        <br> It's just that the whole thing seemed too simple. Obviously roasting a block of feta with bursting tomatoes is going to be amazing.
        <br> But is it good enough to break the internet?
