            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>This is the story about another viral TikTok trend that I kinda sorted wanted to hate...but didn't. It's not that I didn't think the idea sounded delicious.
                <br> It's just that the whole thing seemed too simple. Obviously roasting a block of feta with bursting tomatoes is going to be amazing.
                <br> But is it good enough to break the internet?

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Step:</b>
                <p>Preheat oven to 400°. In a large ovenproof skillet or medium baking dish, combine tomatoes, shallot, and garlic. 
                    <br>Drizzle with about 1/4 cup oil and season with salt. Toss until fully coated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Step:</b>
                <p>Place feta in the center of the tomatoes and shallots and drizzle top with another 1/4 cup olive oil. 
                    <br>Top with thyme sprigs. Bake until tomatoes are bursting and feta is melty, 30 to 35 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Step:</b>
                <p>Meanwhile, in a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. 
                    <br>Reserve ½ cup pasta water before draining.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Step:</b>
                <p>Remove thyme from baking dish and add pasta. 
                    <br>Stir until fully combined and season with more salt. 
                    <br>If pasta seems dry, add a splash of reserved pasta water. 
                    <br>Garnish with lemon zest and basil before serving.</p>
