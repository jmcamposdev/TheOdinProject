# The Odin Project - JavaScript
This is a repository that I will upload all the project and exercises doing The Odin Project JavaScript Full Stack Path

## Structure
The Odin project is divided into two parts:
- `The Foundation`: Which is mandatory and teaches basic concepts about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and setting up your development environment.
- `Path`: The path to follow once you have finished `The Foundation` you can choose between `Full Stack Ruby on Rails` or `Full Stack JavaScript` in my case I chose the JavaScript path.

I will continue to upload exercises and projects.

🚧 This repository is under construction 🚧
