# The Odin Project - JavaScript
This is a repository that I will upload all the project and exercises doing The Odin Project JavaScript Full Stack Path

## Structure
The Odin project is divided into two parts:
- `The Foundation`: Which is mandatory and teaches basic concepts about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and setting up your development environment.
- `Path`: The path to follow once you have finished `The Foundation` you can choose between `Full Stack Ruby on Rails` or `Full Stack JavaScript` in my case I chose the JavaScript path.

# Foundations Course
In this course I learned the bases of HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript working with the DOM, I used in Exercises and Projects the projects are:

# Intermediate HTML and CSS
In this course I learned more about what you can do with HTML and CSS.

# JavaScript Course
In this course, I have gained fundamental knowledge to make my websites dynamic and interactive using JavaScript. Some of the key aspects I have learned include:

1. **DOM Manipulation:** I have learned how JavaScript can be used to dynamically modify and update the content of a web page in real-time. I can create interactions such as showing or hiding elements, changing text and styles, and responding to user events.
2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:** I have acquired a solid understanding of OOP concepts in JavaScript. This enables me to organize my code more efficiently, create reusable objects, and maintain a clearer structure in my applications.
3. **Working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** I have learned how to connect to external web services and fetch real-world data to enrich my applications. This includes the ability to send HTTP requests, receive JSON responses, and dynamically display data on my websites.
4. **Creating Interactive Features:** Through practical projects, I have developed skills to create interactive features and standalone applications using JavaScript. This allows me to build more engaging and functional user experiences.
In summary, this course has provided me with a solid foundation in JavaScript and has empowered me to create dynamic and enriching web applications. I can now manipulate the DOM, apply object-oriented programming principles, and leverage APIs to build interactive and functional websites.
