# Calculator Project

This calculator project represents a significant milestone in my journey to mastering JavaScript. 
In this project, I have built a fully functional on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations, provides a user-friendly interface, and includes additional features such as decimal input and keyboard support.

## Project Description

The calculator project combines a range of fundamental web development skills and concepts. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of this project:

### Arithmetic Operations
The calculator supports the following basic math operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
These operations are implemented as JavaScript functions and are tested in the browser's console.

### User Interface
The calculator has a user-friendly interface with buttons for each digit (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), an equals (=) key, a clear button (C), a decimal (.) button, and a backspace button (âŒ«).

### Calculation Logic
The calculator processes arithmetic operations in the following manner:

User inputs a number, followed by an operator, another number, and so on.
When the equals (=) button is pressed, the calculator evaluates the expression based on the operator precedence and displays the result.
Display
The calculator has a display screen that shows the entered numbers, the selected operator, and the result of the calculation. The display is updated dynamically as the user interacts with the calculator.

### Error Handling
The calculator includes error handling features:

Division by zero: Displays an error message and prevents the calculator from crashing if the user attempts to divide by zero.
Preventing multiple decimals: Disables the decimal button if there's already a decimal point in the display.
Keyboard Support
Users can operate the calculator using the keyboard, providing a convenient alternative to clicking buttons. Keyboard support is implemented with attention to detail, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Knowledge Acquired

During the development of this calculator project, I have acquired valuable knowledge and skills in web development, including:

1. **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Reinforced my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including functions, variables, and event handling.
2. **DOM Manipulation**: Gained hands-on experience in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to create interactive web applications.
3. **Event Handling**: Learned to handle user interactions, such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs, using JavaScript event listeners.
4. **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling techniques to ensure the calculator functions correctly and gracefully handles unexpected user inputs.
5. **CSS Styling**: Enhanced my CSS skills by styling the calculator interface, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
6. **Keyboard Events**: Learned to handle keyboard events, including key presses and preventing default behavior for specific keys.
