# Portfolio - HTML Practice Project
In this project, I have created an entire web page based on a provided design. 
The project is designed to test and apply the HTML and CSS skills I have acquired through The Odin Project's foundation course. 
The primary focus is on replicating the design while learning to work with provided images and implementing basic styling.
